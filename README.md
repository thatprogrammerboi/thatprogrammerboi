- 👋 Hi, I’m @thatprogrammerboi
- 👀 I’m interested in programming with C++ on Arduino and game developement.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning exactly that - C++ programming - and having lots of fun!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now, but I'll probably find something I need help with soon enough.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email aldousjoyce@gmail.com.
